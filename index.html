            <p>
              6G Mission: India's Pursuit of Leadership in Next-Generation Wireless Technology
              <br>
              As the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) embarks on the development of the IMT2030 vision, which is the
              technical foundation for 6G technology, it is essential for India to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of global
              wireless standards. By taking the lead in defining 6G and its key performance requirements, India can influence global standards
              within ITU and 3GPP through enhanced research and development efforts.
              <br>
              The Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) is at the forefront of this mission, spearheading the development of
              prototypes for critical building blocks of 6G Radio Access Network (RAN) technology. These advanced components include
              extreme massive MIMO, distributed MIMO, innovative waveforms, and converged terrestrial and satellite systems.
              <br>
              By fostering an environment of innovation and collaboration, IITH aims to propel Indian technologies into the next
              generation of wireless communication standards. This will not only support the development of an indigenous technology base but
              also contribute to the deployment of advanced systems both in India and across the globe.
              <br>
              India's pursuit of leadership in 6G technology demonstrates the nation's commitment to staying at the cutting
              edge of wireless communication advancements. As we progress towards a connected future, the efforts of IITH and other research
              institutions will play a vital role in shaping the global landscape of next-generation wireless technology.

                  Network Technology</h2>
                  <div class="line-dec"></div>
                  <p>The future of wireless communication is on the horizon, and Open-Radio-Access-Network (ORAN)
                  technology is poised to be a major disruptor in the 5G landscape. This project focuses on
                  developing a new type of radio access network based on ORAN, which promises to enable rapid
                  deployment of low-cost, software upgradable 5G base stations in significantly higher volumes and
                  larger densities than the current 4G network.
                  <br> <br> 
                  ORAN is a software-defined system built on open interfaces and general-purpose hardware. Several
                  operators have already initiated the deployment of ORAN-based software-defined networks (SDN)
                  and virtualized networks that enable self-organization, low operational cost, and ease of
                  introducing new features and service upgrades. This approach allows for rapid introduction of new
                  use cases using software upgrades, as opposed to costly and time-consuming hardware
                  development cycles.
                  <br> <br>
                  Massive MIMO (mMIMO) technology is a key component of the 5G physical layer (PHY), offering
                  substantial capacity and coverage improvements over 4G by utilizing a large number of antennas at
                  the base station. The mMIMO base station stack is a highly complex technology that includes
                  intricate interactions between the Physical Layer and the protocol stack, a level of expertise
                  currently possessed by only a select few multinational vendors.
                  This project aims to develop an indigenous mMIMO stack that will enable India to effectively
                  compete with the world's leading players in this space. By embracing ORAN technology and
                  fostering innovation in 5G+ and 6G base stations, we are paving the way for a more connected,
                  efficient, and adaptable wireless communication ecosystem.

                  <div class="line-dec"></div>
                  <p>Low Bit Rate Wireless Communications has emerged as a key driver for wide-area cellular IoT, encompassing
                  applications such as smart metering, asset and animal tracking, perishable goods management, agri-tech,
                  healthcare, and more. While terrestrial 5G networks provide reliable connectivity in densely populated areas, a
                  significant portion of the world remains unconnected. In recent years, the remarkable reduction in satellite launch
                  costs has paved the way for achieving global, ubiquitous connectivity.
                  <br><br>
                  In this project, the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH) is developing a Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)
                  System-on-Chip (SoC) that supports both terrestrial and Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite-based 5G massive
                  Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) services. The SoC is designed to support up to 200 kHz RF bandwidth and
                  3GPP Release 13/14 specified frequency bands in both low and high cellular bands, including the L-band for
                  enabling GEO Satcom connectivity.
                  <br> <br>
                  This low-cost IoT SoC aims to address the majority of low-bit rate IoT applications expected to emerge in India and
                  around the world in the coming years. By leveraging the convergence of terrestrial and satellite IoT technologies,
                  IITH is pushing the boundaries of connectivity, helping to bridge the digital divide and enable innovative IoT
                  solutions across various industries.

                  <div class="line-dec"></div>
                  <p>The primary objective of this project is to drive research in cutting-edge areas related to 5G and beyond,
                  transforming research outcomes into patents, publications, and standards. By collaborating with the Indian standards
                  forum TSDSI and global standard forums such as 3GPP, ITU, and IEEE, the project aims to incorporate relevant
                  research findings as Standards Essential Patents (SEPs).
                  <br>
                  In addition to research and standardization, this project focuses on developing tailored wireless systems and
                  subsystems for Indian defence and telecom equipment vendors. This involves implementing algorithms developed
                  through the project in the 5G-advanced testbed to create innovative solutions for the Indian market.
                  <br>
                  Another key aspect of this project is building a robust talent pool of experts in 5G and beyond technologies, working
                  across various industries, research, and development organizations. This will ensure that India remains at the
                  forefront of next-generation wireless research and innovation, driving advancements in the global landscape of
                  wireless communication.
